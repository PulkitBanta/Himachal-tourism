				<h2>Maharaja Palace</h2><br>
				<img src="../res/maharajapalace.jpg"><br><br>
				<p style="text-align : justify">
					Region: Himachal Pradesh, Chail<br>
					Constructed In: 1891<br>
					Altitude Location: 2,250 meter<br>
					Special Feature: One tiniest hill resort of Himalaya<br>
					This is the smallest of the hill resorts of Himalaya.<br><br>
					Among the hill resorts of Himalaya, Chail, built on a height of two thousand two hundred fifty m.,
					is the
					tiniest. On being barred from entering the Shimla, Patiala’s King Bhupinder Singh decided to get his
					own
					personal summer capital constructed at Chail which turned out to be the most perfect choice due to
					the
					regality that covers every bit of Chail as it stands bounded by a wall of tall deodar trees. Shimla
					is
					located just forty km. away and is a short journey from this here. From the downtown area of Chail,
					the
					highest point is around 1.5 km., the peak point being at 8000 feet. The Sidh Baba temple in the down
					area of
					Chail is very famous. Legends say that, the King’s palace was actually located here, among the wide
					deodar
					trees. One night, Sidh Baba, the sage, appeared in the dream of the Maharaja to tell him that this
					was the
					holy place where he used to meditate. The very next day, the King moved his palace away from this
					spot. He
					also had a beautiful temple constructed to pay respect to Sidh Baba.<br><br>
					The construction work of Maharaja Palace was completed in 1891. The splendid palace was furnished
					with
					delicate and classic finesse, complete with relaxed bug cottages and huts, tranquil walks through
					wide
					forests, children’s park, extensive lawns, sport facilities and lovers’ hill. This place is actually
					a
					resort which offers the facility to stay in one of the cottages or huts in the surrounding areas, at
					a low
					tariff. The entire Rajgarh cottage, with 4 rooms can be rented, with the kitchen and dining room.
					Monal
					Cottage, Wood Rose Cottage etc. are big double-roomed huts with kitchen. This is the perfect
					honeymoon spot
					for newly-wed couples. The hill resort also gives the exciting opportunity to go trekking and
					fishing, or
					enjoy cricket on the highest cricket pitch of the world. There is also a ground for the royal sport
					of

					chief attractions are the forts of Malaon, Banasar, Subathu and Dhar, all under the boundaries of
					Solan
					district.<br><br>
					Most of the forts of Gurkha regime are said to have been constructed by the citizens of the captured
					cities
					who were enforced to do the hard work and not even paid for it. Mash dal, Lime grind and surkhi were
					used to
					build the stone walls of most of the forts. The Malaon castle at Solan, which is quite near to
					Nalagarh, was
					constructed by Amar Singh Thapa and commemorates territories of western hill's that had been
					detained and
					captured by the Gurkha rulers through the vast struggle among the Sirmour, Hindoor and Kangra states
					who
					tried to control Bara Thakurai, an insignificant state in the west of Garhwal. On January 16, 1815,
					Major
					David Ochterlony had the northern, eastern and southern parts sealed.<br><br>
