		<h2 class="heading">History</h2>
		<p>
			The town of Kangra has a chequered past. It has been sacked a number of times because of the wealth accumulated within the Vajreshwari temple. The immense wealth of this temple attracted Mahmud of Ghazni, the famous plunderer from Central Asia. He looted an enormous treasure trove of gold and silver and jewelry from this temple in AD 1009. The Tughlaq rulers of the Delhi Sultanate again plundered it in 1360. However, the town made a good recovery, and during the reign of the Mughal emperor Jahangir in the early 17th century, this temple was paved with plates of pure silver. This area was ruled by local rulers and was later annexed by the British, who established a garrison in Kangra.

			The small town of Kangra is famous for its Vajreshwari Devi (Kangra Devi) temple. Though the original temple was destroyed in a devastating earthquake, the present one is rebuilt on the same site. A large number of devotees throng this temple during various Hindu festivals. The ancient fort of Nagar Kot is located 2.5 km south of the town, perched on a high windswept ridge.

		<h2 class="heading">Places Around Kangra</h2>
		<p>
			There are a number of important temples near Kangra. The small town of Masrur, 15 km from Kangra, is known for its intricately carved temples. Masrur has a group of 15 sandstone-hewed monolithic rock-cut temples belonging to 10th century AD. The carvings and sculpture found in this group of temple reminds one of the world-famous rock-cut temples of Ellora in the state of Maharashtra. Though most of the temples and sculptures are in a bad shape, yet they reflect the glory of the bygone era. The road from Kangra to Masrur offers magnificent views of the Dhauladhar range. The temple of Jawalamukhi is 34 km south of Kangra. A marvel in itself, it is perhaps the only temple in India where natural jets of flame flare out from the hillside covered by the ancient, holy edifice. The temple has been a major attraction for an assortment of people down the centuries.
