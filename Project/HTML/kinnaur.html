        Lulled by the sweet folk songs of the Kinneri women, the vale of Kinnaur
        provides a calm ambience to all tourists, young and old. While the
        youthful and the daring harness nature's hilltops with their trekking
        expeditions, the more laidback traveler can savor the delight of the
        tranquil mountains amidst the rich verdure. Kinnaur, with its colorful
        and hospitable population, can be an absolute delight for the ones who
        admire the highlanders. This land of fairytales and fantasies has a
        spectacular terrain of lush green valleys, orchards, vineyards snow-clad
        peaks and cold desert mountains.

      <h2 class="heading">Location</h2>
      <p>
        Kinnaur is a border district, located in the southeastern part of the
        northern state of Himachal Pradesh. It is about 250 km from the capital
        Shimla and is situated on National Highway No. 22, which is also called
        the Hindustan-Tibet Road. The landscape of the area varies from the lush
        green orchards of the Sangla Valley to the stark magnificence of the
        Hangrang Valley. The massive snow-clad ranges provide a regal dignity to
        the area. There are about 77 villages in the district and Kalpa is one
        of the biggest of them. There are almost no urban centers. Two turbulent
        rivers race through Kinnaur-the Sutlej and the Spiti. The slopes are
        covered with thick forests, while the basins hold orchards, fields and
        picturesque hamlets. Kinnaur holds three of world's grandest mountain
        ranges-the Zanskar, the Greater Himalaya, and the Dhauladhar-and the
        famous 4,573-meter-high Kinner Kailash mountain by whose side is the
        seventy-nine foot vertical rock formation that resembles a Shivalinga
        and changes color as the day passes
      </p>
      <h2 class="heading">History</h2>
      <p>
        Before India's independence, Kinnaur formed part of the erstwhile
        Bhushhar state. After independence, Kinnaur formed the Chini Tehsil of
        Mahasu district. As part of the reorganization of border areas, the
        Kinnaur district was formed on May 1, 1960, to enable speedy development
        of this area. Kinnaur is home to some of lndia's oldest traditions and
        legends. The Pandava brothers are said to have spent several years of
        their exile in these tracts- an episode from the epic Mahabharata.
        Ancient texts have gone to the extent of placing the people of
        Kinnaur-the Kinners-as halfway between men and gods. The highland tribes
        here are simple, hard working, honest and very welcoming to the
        tourists.
      </p>
      <h2 class="heading">Fair And Festivals</h2>

        (October-November) in Rekongpeo, Phulaich Festival (August-October) in
